# News_Summarization
Participating in JWOC  
This will be text_summarization project,where we'll be using News_Summary[https://www.kaggle.com/sunnysai12345/news-summary] dataset from kaggle, and we'll be working on kaggle itself.A basic knowledge of how neural networks work will be helpful.  
(Apart from just neural networks you'll have to learn how RNNs,LSTMs work and also the various Embedding layers- You can learn these while doing the project) 
This will be a medium-level project and therefore mentees with some experience will be preferable.  

I'll be equally into this project and we'll be doing it together so enthusiastic and dedicated people are all Welcome :smiley:  
Come let's learn together.
